There is a car with capacity empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer capacity and an array trips where trip[i] = [numPassengersi, fromi, toi] indicates that the ith trip has numPassengersi passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are fromi and toi respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return true if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or false otherwise.

 Example 1:

Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
 



lengthOfTrip = [ 0 for _ in range(1001)]
        
        # Update passenger change for each trip
        for trip, i, j in trips:
            lengthOfTrip[i] += trip # Increment when passenger is on board
            lengthOfTrip[j] -= trip # decrement when they depart
    
        carLoad = 0
        # Count total passenger for each bus top
        # we have the count array, we perform a line sweep from 0 to 1000 and track its total
        for i in range( len(lengthOfTrip) ):
            carLoad += lengthOfTrip[i] 
            if carLoad > capacity: # Reject when the car is overloaded somewhere
                return False                
        return True
